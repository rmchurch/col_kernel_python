Simple test of the ability of the ML collision operator to isotropize a bi-Maxwellian distribution function, 
with ion and electron temperatures also different. Should replicate Figure 3 from Hager, R., & Chang, C. S. (2016). "Gyrokinetic neoclassical study of the bootstrap current in the tokamak edge pedestal with fully non-linear Coulomb collisions." Physics of Plasmas, 23(4), 042503. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4945615

**NOTE: Currently not working, density rising too much**

Code relies on the ReSeg model and trained weights, and training on a GPU (can modify for CPU testing).
